Open CV Assignment

4.1 EXERCISE 1

    The Matrices are stored in Row Major order. This means that we can access the element using the row and the column index. For an image with x and y coordinates, mat.at(row,col) = mat.at(y,x).

5.1 EXERCISE 2

    The output of ColorImage.cpp shows the conversion to different colorspaces starting from an original image that is in the RGB format.
The image is first split with only Red, Green and Blue parts and those are displayed. Then the image is converted to Ycrcb image and it is again split into Y, Cr and Cb components and displayed as three different images. Then it is converted to HSV colorspace and is then split into the Hue, Saturation and Value and printed as three different images.
